The study guide presents my notes on the four pre-work topics: 
HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Git. To demonstrate javaScript code, the page will print these topics to the browser console (view in developer tools). As an extra feature, 
the javaScript code will suggest a random topic and print it to console as well.

## Credits

I followed the tutorial provided by bootcamp pre-work.
